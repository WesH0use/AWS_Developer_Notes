Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale. API developers can create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud.
  
A usage plan specifies who can access one or more deployed API stages and methodsâ€”and also how much and how fast they can access them. The plan uses API keys to identify API clients and meters access to the associated API stages for each key.

You can configure usage plans and API keys to allow customers to access selected APIs at agreed-upon request rates and quotas that meet their business requirements and budget constraints.
