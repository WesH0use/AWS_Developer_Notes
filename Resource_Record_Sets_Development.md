## CNAME Records

A CNAME record maps DNS queries for the name of the current record, such as acme.example.com, to another domain (example.com or example.net) or subdomain (acme.example.com or zenith.example.org).

CNAME records can be used to map one domain name to another. Although you should keep in mind that the DNS protocol does not allow you to create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace, also known as the zone apex. For example, if you register the DNS name example.com, the zone apex is example.com. You cannot create a CNAME record for example.com, but you can create CNAME records for www.example.com, newproduct.example.com, and so on.

## Alias Records

Create an Alias Record - Alias records let you route traffic to selected AWS resources, such as CloudFront distributions and Amazon S3 buckets. They also let you route traffic from one record in a hosted zone to another record. 3rd party websites do not qualify for these as we have no control over those. 'Alias record' cannot be used to map one domain name to another.

## Practice Questions 

# An application is hosted by a 3rd party and exposed at yourapp.3rdparty.com. You would like to have your users access your application using www.mydomain.com, which you own and manage under Route 53. What Route 53 record should you create?
