EFS volumes provide a simple, scalable, and persistent file storage for use with your Amazon ECS tasks. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files. Your applications can have the storage they need, when they need it. Amazon EFS volumes are supported for tasks hosted on Fargate or Amazon EC2 instances.

You can use Amazon EFS file systems with Amazon ECS to export file system data across your fleet of container instances. That way, your tasks have access to the same persistent storage, no matter the instance on which they land. However, you must configure your container instance AMI to mount the Amazon EFS file system before the Docker daemon starts. Also, your task definitions must reference volume mounts on the container instance to use the file system.

## Practice Questions

# ECS Fargate container tasks are usually spread across Availability Zones (AZs) and the underlying workloads need persistent cross-AZ shared access to the data volumes configured for the container tasks. Which of the following solutions is the best choice for these workloads?
